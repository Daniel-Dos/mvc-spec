\chapter{Applications}
\label{applications}

This chapter introduces the notion of an \mvc\ application and explains how it 
relates to a \jaxrs\ application.

\section{\mvc\ Applications}
\label{mvc_applications}

An \mvc\ application consists of one or more \jaxrs\ resources that are annotated with 
\Controller\ and, just like \jaxrs\ applications, zero or more providers. If no
resources are annotated with \Controller, then the resulting application is a \jaxrs\
application instead. In general, everything that applies to a \jaxrs\ application
also applies to an \mvc\ application. Some \mvc\ applications may be {\em hybrid}
and include a mix of \mvc\ controllers and \jaxrs\ resource methods.

The controllers and providers that make up an application are configured via an 
application-supplied subclass of \code{Application} from \jaxrs. An implementation 
MAY provide alternate mechanisms for locating controllers, but as in \jaxrs, 
the use of an \code{Application} subclass is the only way to guarantee portability.

All the rules described in the Servlet section of the \jaxrs\ Specification
\cite{jaxrs} apply to \mvc\ as well. This section recommends the use of
the Servlet 3 framework pluggability mechanism and describes its semantics
for the cases in which an \code{Application} subclass is present and absent. 

The path in the application's URL space in which \mvc\ controllers live must
be specified either using the \ApplicationPath\ annotation on the application
subclass or in the web.xml as part of the \code{url-pattern} element. \mvc\
applications MUST use a non-empty path or pattern: i.e., {\em "/"} or {\em "/*"} are 
invalid in \mvc\ applications \assertref{application-path}. 

The reason for this is that \mvc\ implementations
often forward requests to the Servlet container, and the use of these
values may result in the unwanted processing of the forwarded request
by the \jaxrs\ servlet once again. Most \jaxrs\ applications avoid using
these values, and many use \code{"/resources"} or \code{"/resources/*"} by 
convention. For consistency, it is recommended for MVC applications to use
these patterns as well.

\section{Providers in \mvc}
\label{providers_in_mvc}

Implementations are free use their own providers in order to modify the standard 
\jaxrs\ pipeline for the purpose of implementing the \mvc\ semantics. Whenever mixing 
implementation and application providers, care should be taken to ensure the correct 
execution order using priorities.

\begin{ednote}
Should the range of priorities for any \mvc -related providers be defined?
